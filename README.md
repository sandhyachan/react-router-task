# React Router Task

## Overview

This project implements a simple web page using **React Router** for navigation. The application displays different course categories such as **All**, **Full Stack Development**, **Data Science**, **Cyber Security**, and **Career**. Each category is shown on a separate route with corresponding content displayed dynamically based on the data fetched from a JSON file.

The layout and navigation mimic the design seen on the [Guvi Blog](https://www.guvi.in/blog/), with a responsive grid of cards representing courses.
